I put these tasks in priority by importance to completing the game. I
could be wrong so change it as necessary, but otherwise let's try to
work down this list in priority order.  -wkmanire

WALL COLLISIONS

While it is priority #1, I am going to hold off on it and we can focus on the
other items on the list.  The reason being, I need to rethink a few things, and
I also need to change my current task so I don't go crazy.  Sprite to Sprite
collision works, so we can still implement items and enemies.


For now, wall collision check is disabled.  -abroham lincoln
